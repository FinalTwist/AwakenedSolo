A Discord bot for connecting your MUD's OOC channel to a Discord server. Requires the creation of a file named .env in your home directory. Said file must contain all of the variables listed at the top of bot.py.

Zipped to prevent CodeQL from complaining about the presence of unscanned python. Just unzip it.
