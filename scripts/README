Systemd unit file and dependent pre/post scripts.

The unit file assumes that Awake is under the user's home directory in AwakeMUD
(eg /home/user/AwakeMUD), If that is not the case then edit the unit file with
correct path.

Copy awakemud@.service to /etc/systemd/system
"systemctl daemon-reload" to reload configuration
"systemctl enable --now awakemud@user_name" to enable the service to start on boot and start.

For more info on starting and stopping systemd units etc look in systemd manual.

Service is configured to autorestart 10 seconds always as gdb handling the crash exits cleanly
so on-failure won't do.
