Systemd unit file and dependent pre/post scripts.

The unit file assumes that Awake is under the user's home directory in AwakeMUD
(eg /home/user/AwakeMUD), If that is not the case then edit the unit file with
correct path.

Copy awakemud@.service to /etc/systemd/system
"systemctl daemon-reload" to reload configuration
"systemctl enable --now awakemud@user_name" to enable the service to start on boot and start.

For more info on starting and stopping systemd units etc look in systemd manual.

Service is configured to autorestart 10 seconds after any kind of failure. It will not restart
on shutdown command from the MUD but that if the behavior is desired the unit file directive
can be changed from "on-failure" to "always".
