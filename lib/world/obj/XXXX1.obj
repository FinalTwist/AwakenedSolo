An uninstalled datajack is lying here.~
LookDesc:$
The almost-universal mark of the cyber-conscious user, standard datajacks allow 
input and output to certain pieces of cyberware and gear. Datajacks allow the 
user to cybernetically interface with properly equipped gear such as cyberdecks,
remote-control decks and vehicles with datajack ports, so that the user can
manipulate them, issue commands and so forth.
^n
Datajacks allow the user to mentally access headware memory. Contents of softs
can also be downloaded into headware memory through a datajack. Knowsofts cannot
be accessed through a datajack without a knowsoft link, datasofts cannot be
accessed without a display or image link, and activesofts cannot be accessed
without skillwires. Data fed into a datajack (from a cyberdeck, tridlinked
cybercam, vehicle and so on) can in turn be fed into a display link, image link
or headware memory.
^n
Deckers usually implant datajacks in their temples to access higher-brain
functions, while riggers usually have them behind and below the ears, where they
access the submandibular glands and lower brain. It is not unusual for some
people to have more than one datajack.~
