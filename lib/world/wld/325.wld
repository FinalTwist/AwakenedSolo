Name:	Harbour Avenue and Ridgeway Street
Desc:$
   Food wrappers, leaflets and the occasional dried leaf drift across the
cracked sidewalks of this none-too-clean intersection. A dry, cold breeze
whistles through the street, silenced occasionally by the distant rumbling of
factories along Seattle's outer skyline, and various cars from what seems like
another age pass quietly by.

Name:	Harbour Avenue
Desc:$
   Harbour Avenue runs north and south along the more desolate western edge of
downtown Seattle's industrial district. Many of the storefronts here are
boarded over, with the exception of what seems to be a thriving restaurant to
the west. A moderately busy bus station, which provides transportation to
other cities, is to the east.

Inside the cars that wait silently for the right of way, tired and pale

   Just a few blocks away from the district center, a small group of children
play with a skipping rope and divide their attention between the various
trideo screens in a storefront displaying the newest skipping rope available.
With extra sparkle.

looks healthy and nourished, the odd banana every now and then seems to keep

   A taxi lulls idly by across the street, the owner more interested in
listening to a baseball game than actually picking up passengers. Behind him,
a small store that appears to sell candy and porn seems to be attracting more
than a fair share of shoppers.

   The whirring of factory fans overhead begins to camouflage the incessant

factories in the area, in an effort to both increase employment in the area,
and keep their operations out of the public eye.

   Ridgeway runs into First Street here at a busy cross-street intersection.
Traffic is poorly managed and gets backed up quite often here, in close
proximity to Intercity Five. Ridgeway east of here moves close to the towering
spires of downtown's higher-density commercial sector, through an artist and
nightclub sector. Many of the city's more bohemian elements frequent the many
shops, clubs, and coffee holes that you find on the next two blocks east of
here, before reaching the portion of downtown populated by tall towers of
plasticrete and steel. A small neon sign above a doorway to the northeast
reads, "^RLe Cinema Vieux^n."

Name:	First Street
Desc:$
   First Street is a working-class stretch of the southeast commercial
district of downtown Seattle. It's a bunch of brick and plasticrete tenements,
stained with years worth of rain, and shopfronts on the first floor. There are
two newspaper vending boxes with the Seattle Times and Seattle Sun here, two
competing papers with different angles. Seattle Times is more hard news,
whereas the Seattle Sun is an unrepentant screamsheet or tabloid. The traffic
is thick to moderate here, and the air is full of the sound of a freeway
within close proximity. An open doorway to the east leads into a small brick
brownstone, its rather dirty plate glass window advertising a theatrical
supply shop.

Name:	First Street and Espanoza Way
Desc:$
   On the very western end of the southeast commercial district of Downtown
Seattle, this intersection, infamous throughout North America as the most
accident prone,  is full of a nightmare of jammed vehicles, speeders, and
places to be cut off.  Just west of here is the Intercity Five exit, and many
drivers forced to drive quickly down the exit, find themselves being forced to
stop abruptly after going down the offramp.  The traffic is stop and go at all
hours, the lights are poorly timed, and the smog is thick. On the sidewalks
are crowds of people in breathers and raincoats, to gird their lungs from the
smog and acid rain fumes.   A lost pet poster is plastered against the
stoplight pole.

Desc:$
   Largely a diversified working-class block between Whitman and Espanoza,
First street is lined with newsstands, ramen noodle stands, soy dog stands,
and apartment complexes with storefronts on the first floor, selling books and
second hand clothes.  On the east side of the street is a boarded up
storefront, formerly a bar named after a mafia kingpin named "Pook".

Desc:$
   Second and Whitman meet at a busy intersection.  The poorly timed stoplight
here has created a traffic jam that exists on a near 24 hour a day basis.
Messengers on bicycles whip through the gridlocked traffic, using the spaces
in between the lanes to get ahead of the parking-lot like traffic conditions.
The air is filled with a vague smoggy smell, and people in breathers are a
common sight here.

   Second Street runs through the western end of the southeastern district of
Downtown Seattle, a largely commercial district.  The plasticrete walls on
each side of the street are covered with an array of handbills, advertising
the many corporations and media conglomerates that have set up shop in the
area.  Farther south you can see an array of large neon signs and trid
billboards for various companies.

alarming speeds. On the overpass you see a great deal of graffiti left there
from the various gangs that inhabit the Seattle area, from the Brain Eaters to
the Ancients to the Halloweeners, in their various colours, crossing out each
others to mark this as their turf.  Sirens fill the air in the distance to the
east, showing Lone Star's presence in this area.

under it into the Northeast sector, a largely commercial zone dominated by
office buildings, with Mitsuhama Tower and the Aztechnology Pyramid upon the
skyline.
