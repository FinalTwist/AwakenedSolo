Rain needles the span; runoff gathers, leaps, and shatters below.
Boot soles squeak, slide, then recover in a small private miracle.
A wind gust flips umbrellas inside out and sends curses downstream.
Spray from a truckâ€™s wake coats the railing in fine grit.
The river swells and pretends to be a lake for a minute.
