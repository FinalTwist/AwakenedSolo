Lightning sketches the arcology’s ribs; inside, light answers with a careful hush.
Umbrella flowers fold at the threshold, waterlines climbing fiber pots.
Security drones pace the atrium in patient figure eights.
A floor polisher writes temporary moons that fade as quickly as they form.
Café chairs stack themselves; one squeaks like a complaint and is ignored.
