Harbor ropes groan; a cleat complains as the tide tugs and lets go.
A gull strafes low and tags a shoulder; the jacket will tell the story later.
Salt crystals crunch underfoot where the spray dried too slow.
A crate drops somewhere mid-pier; a chorus of curses follows the thud.
A buoy bell counts waves in a language the city still remembers.
