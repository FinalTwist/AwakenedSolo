Doors kiss shut; the car hums and draws its breath from the third rail.
A seat announces its displeasure with a rubbery protest as someone sits wrong.
An ad screen hiccups into a free-verse error and stays there.
A map above the exit blinks one station out; a pen corrects it in blue.
A shoelace flirts with the edge and survives by luck.
