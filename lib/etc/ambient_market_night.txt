Lanterns swing from stall to stall; their glow lures moths and the occasional drone.
A back table craps game erupts; dice bounce into a crate of knockoff sunglasses.
Dead screens blink awake long enough to show a static ad, then sigh back to sleep.
Someone tests a stun baton; a blue arc crackles and the crowd steps wider.
A load-haulerâ€™s gyro whines; crates rise, wobble, settle with a relieved creak.
