Rain finds the skylights and narrates weather to those beneath.
Runoff snakes through planned channels; planters drink like champions.
A mirrored column catches a stray drop and pretends itâ€™s a star.
Power doors hesitate, then admit a dripping crowd with corporate grace.
Courier pads mark the terrazzo, then vanish as air dries them away.
