Stormwater hammers the ducts; each elbow answers with a different drum.
A lightning flash inventories the yard and finds it wanting.
A craneâ€™s red eye blinks sleepily through sheets of rain.
Steam from a vent rises, marries the downpour, and vanishes into ceiling darkness.
Somewhere a tool falls, rings twice, then is forgiven.
