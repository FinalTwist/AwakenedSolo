Cables sing a low note as a truck rolls by and the deck breathes.
Wind grabs a cap and carries it three lanes before mercy intervenes.
A commuter tosses a coin; the river swallows it without drama.
A gull drafts the updraft and laughs like a heckler.
A love lock fails rust and drops, unnoticed, to the water.
