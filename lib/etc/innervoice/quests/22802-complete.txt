intel gathered at sprint speed. the city wheezed, you didn’t.
everyone talked eventually. amazing what motivation can do.
deliverables tidied, timelines fed. you were a courier of truth.
sometimes the quiet jobs sing. this one hummed in the right key.
no bullets needed. i’m almost disappointed. almost.
