new quest! i filed it under ‘Some, Stuffer Shack
Incorporated, All’ and ‘questionable life choices’.

the brief says Some, Stuffer Shack
Incorporated, All. the subtext says ‘try not to explode’.
ooh, lore drop: Some, Stuffer Shack
Incorporated, All. i’ll pretend i understood all of it.
sign here to consent to adventure and minor narrative whiplash.
