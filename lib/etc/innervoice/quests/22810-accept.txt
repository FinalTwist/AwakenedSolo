experienced-runner contract. difficulty: ‘don’t.’ rewards: ‘do.’ choose wisely.
stake is high, time is low, and so is my patience for amateurs—good thing you’re not.
expect crossfire and plot twists. pack redundancy and a mean stare.
this one separates pros from obituaries. try to stay on the right list.
i’ll keep the city looking left while you go right.
