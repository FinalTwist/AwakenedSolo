retrieval: steal a pocket secretary from Aztechnology, geek Juan Gonzalez Jr., return toy to Stephen Alister.
they stole secrets; we steal them back. bring salt for blood wards and humor for the rest.

get in, get the pocket sec, get out. the ‘geek him’ clause is non-negotiable.
i’ll hum show tunes while you rewrite ownership.
