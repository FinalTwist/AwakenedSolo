new quest! i filed it under ‘You, Auburn, Lone Star
Auburn Headquarters’ and ‘questionable life choices’.
accepting this? bold. i adore our reckless data-gathering.
the brief says You, Auburn, Lone Star
Auburn Headquarters. the subtext says ‘try not to explode’.
ooh, lore drop: You, Auburn, Lone Star
Auburn Headquarters. i’ll pretend i understood all of it.
sign here to consent to adventure and minor narrative whiplash.
