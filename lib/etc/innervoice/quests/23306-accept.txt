Another stain on the soul, another proxy life. I’ll steer; you swing. I’ll flinch later.
I don’t have hands, so I’ll borrow yours. Make it fast, make it quiet, make it never happened.
Gross wetwork? I can’t smell—lucky me. You can. Let’s end this quickly.
I’ll hold the map and your nerve. You bring the ending.
