subjects culled, scientist recovered, facility pride slightly restored.
you turned a massacre-in-progress into a rescue story. editors hate happy endings.
VIP breathing, monsters not. that’s the ratio we like.
you navigated a lab built by people who hate people. subtle flex.
cash transferred. i sent the scientist a ‘try not to die’ calendar.
