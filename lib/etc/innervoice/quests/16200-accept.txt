Seoulpa ring problem in Puyallup. deliver a ‘conversation’ to the boss and his lieutenant—heavy on the punctuation.
think of it as conflict resolution with terminal punctuation. i’ll draft the eulogies.
two heads, zero diplomacy. i highlighted their last known hangouts in murder-pink.
optional objectives: any extra Seoulpa you ‘talk to’. i’ll keep score with glitter.
you bring the lullaby; i’ll kill the lights.
