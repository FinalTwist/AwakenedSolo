nanite lab fiasco. get inside, breach the concealed wall on 6F with the keycard, pull the data, get out breathing.
containment is… theoretical. expect clever grease with knives. don’t let it touch you.
if the wall looks like a wall, it’s not a wall. love corporate interior design.
exfil route pre-scrubbed; alarms set to ‘disappointed sigh’. move fast anyway.
retrieve the research, not the regrets. i’ll launder the metadata.
