Missing kid. No ledger looks good with that entry. Trace the trail, ignore the noise, bring the heartbeat home.
Underground eats the inattentive. Stay loud enough to be heard, quiet enough to pass. I’ll light breadcrumbs only you can see.
If monsters took him, you take him back. If mistakes did—same remedy.
I’ll jam the vultures who try to sell you directions.
