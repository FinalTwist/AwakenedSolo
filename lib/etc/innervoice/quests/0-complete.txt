somehow you completed the impossible tutorial. speedrunners will sing of this exploit.
bug neutralized. or maybe it learned to purr. either way, my logs are pleased.
the quest was incomplete; your dedication wasnâ€™t. i archived the paradox for later snickering.
result: done-ish. verdict: paid. mood: smug.
we broke reality a little and got away with it. classic.
