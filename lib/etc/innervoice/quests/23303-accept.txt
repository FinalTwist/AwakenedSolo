infiltration gig: get in, get proof, get out. and try not to start a cult while you’re in there.
doors are honest; walls lie. believe neither.
bring soft shoes and hard choices.
your toolkit is ‘yes, and’. improvise like your life depends on it—because it does.
i’ll serenade the sensors with white noise. you dance.
