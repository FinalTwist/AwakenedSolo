new quest! i filed it under ‘Have, Gopher, Ork
Underground’ and ‘questionable life choices’.
accepting this? bold. i adore our reckless data-gathering.
the brief says Have, Gopher, Ork
Underground. the subtext says ‘try not to explode’.
ooh, lore drop: Have, Gopher, Ork
Underground. i’ll pretend i understood all of it.
sign here to consent to adventure and minor narrative whiplash.
