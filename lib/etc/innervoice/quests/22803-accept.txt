delivery run with teeth. multiple drops, some hostile doorsteps. smile mean.
you’re the mail; the world is junk. make the route sacred anyway.
if they refuse a package, accept their apology in advance.
i’ll juggle signatures and alibis while you juggle distance and danger.
when in doubt, leave it on the altar and jog.
