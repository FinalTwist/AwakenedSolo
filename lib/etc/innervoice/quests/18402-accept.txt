bad juju in the tunnels. Mobi—big, fast, wrong—wants topside. you’re the firewall.
find the rat-thing and end the chapter before it hits daylight and the newsfeeds.
shaman says he birthed it; spirits stole it. we’ll handle the custody battle… terminally.
bring light, bring steel, bring a nose clip. i’ll keep the maps from screaming.
goal: keep ‘giant rat’ off the evening trideo. please and thank you.
