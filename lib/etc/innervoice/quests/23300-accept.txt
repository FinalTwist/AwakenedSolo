mysterious package in Tarislar with a note that tells the rest. we’re doing espionage by scavenger hunt.
someone upstairs is watching you. try not to trip over destiny on the way.
fetch the note, follow the breadcrumbs, don’t eat the bread.
i’ll keep comms low and paranoia high. you handle the plot.
this smells like a promotion wrapped in string.
