all parcels kissed their destinations. even the ones that tried to bite.
your route looked like a heartbeat and felt like a threat. loved it.
receipts forged, tempers managed, distance devoured. chef’s courier.
no undeliverables, no excuses, big grin.
i stamped the last manifest ‘don’t try this at home’.
