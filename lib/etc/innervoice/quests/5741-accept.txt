Hermes left a briefcase at your place; we’re the adult supervision. Grab it, return it, don’t peek—curiosity charges interest.
If it clicks, don’t cuddle it. If it hums, hum back and keep walking.
We’re delivering competence with plausible deniability packaging.
I’ll route you around the nosy neighbors with binoculars and no lives.
