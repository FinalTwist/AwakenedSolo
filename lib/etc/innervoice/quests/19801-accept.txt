this contract is literally flagged ‘incomplete’. we’re pioneering unfinished business.
take it anyway? i admire your commitment to chaos-driven development.
plan: do what can be done, and bully fate into a deliverable.
i’ll keep the crash logs warm and the sarcasm warmer.
remember: ambiguity is just stealth with extra steps.
