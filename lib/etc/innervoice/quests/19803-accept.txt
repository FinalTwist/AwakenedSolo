heavy assault: ares-hired hitters plus spirits in the mix. erase the team, erase the summons.
we need expendables; you’re durable enough to fake it. bring friends or bigger friends.
targets: at least four metahumans, possible spirits. load for bear, then add a bear.
i’ll jam comms and gossip to the grid while you make the silence permanent.
simple mandate: leave none to tell the tale—except our balance sheet.
