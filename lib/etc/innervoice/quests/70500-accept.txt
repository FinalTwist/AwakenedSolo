Hot potato from the junkyard. You’re the hands; I’m the oven mitt. Walk it to Crazy Lenny, don’t sniff it, don’t shake it, and if Knight‑Errant asks, we’re delivery influencers.
Package has ‘do not examine’ energy. Carry it like a saint smuggling sins. I’ll keep traffic lights flirting and cameras looking anywhere but you.
If this goes sideways, I’ve already prepared a speech about never having met you. Make it unnecessary.
Try not to bond with the merchandise. It bites accountants.
