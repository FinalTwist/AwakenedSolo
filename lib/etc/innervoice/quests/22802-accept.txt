fast legwork: run messages, shake trees, make people say things. minimal gunfire, optional menace.
time is the enemy; your sneakers are the weapon. go make the city sweat.
i’ll line up the waypoints; you connect the dots with attitude.
if someone stalls, escalate from charm to subtitles.
pretend it’s easy. it will believe you.
