Mitsuhama sniffing our methods. Names like Yuzikawa and Sun Ci hover; you swat. I’ll keep the grid distracted.
Corporate curiosity is a disease. Apply you as the cure. I’ll chart the fever break.
Polite violence, please. We have a reputation to uphold.
I’ll thread the cameras like a needle; you thread the target.
