another hitter’s dance. same music, different corpse. bring choreography and spare mags.
names change, bodyguards don’t: numerous and overconfident. correct them.
leave the right souvenir in the right office—branding matters.
this is violence with paperwork. i pre-filled the forms.
i’ll hold the door; you bring the thunder.
