Sliding into humanskin leggings? Bold. The city will pretend not to stare; I won’t.
Feel that cling? That’s the past hugging your shins—morbidly sustainable.
Walk soft; the stitches remember secrets louder than footfalls.
Every step is a confession. Try not to squeak when the street asks questions.
