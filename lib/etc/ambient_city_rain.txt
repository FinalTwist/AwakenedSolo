Rain hammers billboard vinyl; ink bleeds and streaks across the sidewalk like mascara tears.
A bus hits a pothole and baptizes the curb in oily water and gum wrappers.
Wet neon pools around manhole lips; steam rises in cylinders that collapse as a train passes below.
A vending machine coughs and ejects a warm bottle that rolls to a stop against a toe.
A gutter cam rotates, blinks away droplets, and resumes judging the street.
