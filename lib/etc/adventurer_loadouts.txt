# Optional: Each line is a space-separated list of object VNUMs to give to a spawned adventurer.
# The system picks one random line and attempts to load each VNUM to inventory (best effort).
# Example (replace with objects that exist in your world):
# 2003 2010 3050   # pistol / ammo / jacket
# 2100 3120 4050   # katana / armor vest / first-aid kit
