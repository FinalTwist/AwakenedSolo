Conveyors thrum; a loose screw skates across a metal plate and disappears.
A safety beacon hiccups, painting the floor with one lazy amber pulse.
A forklift backs; its warning chirp echoes between steel ribs.
Overhead, a hook glides by with quiet menace and an even quieter payload.
A stack releases a cough of steam; hot air flattens hair, then moves on.
