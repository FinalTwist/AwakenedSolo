Storm runoff fattens the channel; turbid waves shoulder past labels and regrets.
Floating trash forms a brief island, crowns itself, dissolves.
A ladder rung sweats; a boot prints it and leaves a muddy signature.
Vent gas burps; droplets shiver on rust.
A sump pump coughs to life, then finds its rhythm.
