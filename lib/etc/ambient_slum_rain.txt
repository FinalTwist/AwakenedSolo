Tarp roofs belly; someone jabs a broom handle up and births a brown waterfall.
Alley chalk art melts into pastel rivers that dodge trash and toes.
A smell of cinnamon fights damp diesel and almost wins.
A neon Jesus blinks at half power, forgiving the outage.
A bucket brigade passes, jokes passing faster.
