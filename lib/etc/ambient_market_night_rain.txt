Lantern halos smear on wet tarps; each step sets off a chorus of squeaks and sighs.
A stray spark from a soldering iron leaps, dies, leaves a ruby pinprick in the dark plastic.
Rain chains gush; a child sails a leaf boat past boots and bargain bins.
A shutter bangs open, a hand trades cash, the shutter bangs closed.
A chime app glitch loops a cheerful tone until a fist persuades silence.
