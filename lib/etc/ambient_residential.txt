Wind chimes negotiate with a passing truck and reach a settlement.
A package bot deposits a parcel and an unsolicited survey on the stoop.
Sprinklers burp awake and turn lawns into obedient glisten.
A curtain lifts, reveals a cat, lowers with theatrical regret.
Bikes clatter in a rack; laughter explains the physics.
