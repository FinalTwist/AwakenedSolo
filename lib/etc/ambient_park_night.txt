Path lights wake in sequence like a patient spine aligning.
Something rustles the dogwood; only the tail emerges before vanishing again.
A slow joggerâ€™s breath fogs the air; a bench display counts pulses and winks.
Sprinklers tick once, think better, and remain quiet under the stars.
An owl rides a thermal from the reflecting pool, silent as a thought.
