Stormlight turns the avenue into chrome; siren reflections braid and unbraid in the torrent.
A drone loses altitude, skims a canopy, and sheds a fin that clatters into the drain.
Thunder arrives late; somewhere a car alarm decides to join the conversation.
An AR billboard desyncs, throwing ragged halos across puddles before recalibrating.
Crosswalk sensors flash red as a rat ferries a soaked bun to safety.
