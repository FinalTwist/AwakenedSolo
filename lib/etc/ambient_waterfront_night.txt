Sodium lamps paint the swells copper; a shadowed fin sketches lazy cursive.
A trawler coughs awake; deck LEDs climb from stern to bow like vertebrae.
Two lovers’ whispers tangle with rigging; the wind edits generously.
A customs skiff idles, then peels away, leaving a ribbon of phosphorescence.
Far out, a container’s door booms once and the echo walks ashore.
