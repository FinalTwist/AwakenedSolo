Cleaning bots parade in formation, polish blooming behind their tails.
A lone executive crosses marble; footsteps sound like signatures.
Badge readers blink a steady heartbeat into the empty air.
A boardroom screen rotates through sunsets no one will see.
HVAC sighs; the building dreams of quarterly goals.
