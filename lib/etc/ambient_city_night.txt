Headlights comb the boulevard; a stray cat rides the beam then vanishes under a humming sedan.
An alley sign buzzes to life, strobing kanji over a pair of sprinting silhouettes.
A rooftop party drops a cascade of ice that shatters into crystal along the gutter.
A courier’s bike skids; phosphor brake dust paints an arc across the lane.
Security shutters rattle down; the last shop’s hologram waves and dissolves.
