Rain drums the grate; the tunnel replies with bass the chest understands.
A distant squeal announces a train like chalk on a wet board.
Ticket gates blink sleepy green; one blinks nothing at all.
A poster peels itself halfway, gives up, hangs like a defeated tongue.
A rat parades a pilfered donut fragment to thunderous private acclaim.
