Porch lights pop on in a cascade, then pretend it was coincidence.
A late movie bleeds through a wall as muffled heroics and popcorn acoustics.
A hover-mower coughs once and gives up for the evening.
Distant voices tally the day, subtract the worst parts, and head inside.
A security camera blinks itself drowsy and keeps the secret.
