Wet coats steam as the platform warms them from the knees up.
Waterfalls descend the stairwells, choose tracks, and vanish as if paid to.
An umbrella shakes itself clean and baptizes three strangers impartially.
The PA coughs, promises clarity, delivers poetry instead.
A puddle claims a footprint and refuses to return it.
