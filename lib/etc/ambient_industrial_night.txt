Security lights sculpt long shadows from short equipment.
A maintenance drone skitters into a vent with a dropped zip-tie prize.
Somewhere a relay slaps; the corridor counts the clicks down to silence.
A catwalk trembles under unseen footfalls, then stills as if embarrassed.
A halogen bulb buzzes itself brave and stays that way.
