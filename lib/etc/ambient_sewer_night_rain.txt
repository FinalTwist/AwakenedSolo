Vault echoes turn raindrops into marching bands a block overhead.
A surge lifts a pallet and escorts it along like a reluctant barge.
A flashlight beam from above skims the surface, fails, and gives up.
A swarm of insects sews a moving seam above the black flow.
A hatch bangs twice, then decides it meant once.
