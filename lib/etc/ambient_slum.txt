Wind tangles laundry lines; a shirt flaps like a flag of stubborn nations.
A bottle rolls from a doorway, considers the gutter, and commits.
A window flickers with pirated cinema until a silhouette blocks the plot.
A stray dog shakes, christening everything within arm’s length.
A vendor’s pot erupts; neighbors laugh, then line up with bowls.
