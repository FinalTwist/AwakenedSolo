Lightning turns the harbor glass-flat; thunder scatters it back into shards.
A storm gust tears a poster loose; it slaps the pier, then glues itself down.
The lighthouse blinks; rain turns each flash into a drifting halo.
Chains clatter in a rhythm older than the cranes that hold them.
Runoff carries a paper boat past boots and off the edge without ceremony.
