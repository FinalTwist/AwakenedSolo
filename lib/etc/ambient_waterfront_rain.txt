Rain pebbles the bay; each circle races another until both vanish.
Dock planks darken in stripes where leaks fail and succeed.
A slick rope slaps the bollard and flicks cold water into passing faces.
A horn bleats; gulls explode from a rail and settle farther down like a moving scarf.
Spray mingles with fresh rain and salts lips without asking.
