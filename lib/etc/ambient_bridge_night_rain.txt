Headlights atomize rain into glitter; every lane becomes a galaxy.
A lightning stitch zips the clouds; the bridge flinches, then grins.
Navigation buoys answer with polite, rhythmic nods.
A police cruiser idles, wipers metronoming official patience.
A hatless jogger negotiates with the storm and loses by degrees.
