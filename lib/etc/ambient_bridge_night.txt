Tail lights draw molten threads to the horizon; the river combs them apart.
A barge barks once; the echo tucks itself under the girders.
LED beacon strobes count in threes; the skyline answers in fives.
A lone bicycle ticks past, chain whispering in the dark.
Fog arrives in scarves and chooses favorite shoulders.
