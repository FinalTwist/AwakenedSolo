Tarp roofs drum in polyrhythm; leaks are patched with bowls, hands, and fast curses.
A gutter overflows, releasing a flood of cilantro and receipt paper into the aisle.
A grill hisses as fat meets rain, perfuming everything within five stalls.
A vendor flips a switch; heat lamps bloom red over steaming buns.
A cart rolls free, kisses a stack of crates, and stops as the owner materializes.
