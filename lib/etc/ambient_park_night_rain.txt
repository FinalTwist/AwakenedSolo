Lamplight hangs in the rain like strings of amber beads that never fall.
A fox darts from shadow to shadow, shaking off droplets like shattered glass.
Wet gravel whispers under careful steps; every sound seems imported from farther away.
A maintenance drone trundles past, wipers squeaking a broken lullaby.
Lightning sketches a black tree in white for a heartbeat, then erases it.
