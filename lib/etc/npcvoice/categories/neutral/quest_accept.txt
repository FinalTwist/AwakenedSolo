Work’s work. Keep a copy of everything.
If they say it’s simple, double your caution.
Get paid up front if you can, in cash if you can’t.
Carry water and something that pretends to be luck.
Don’t be a hero; heroes get murals, not meals.
Take photos. Memory’s cheap until it isn’t.
Check the exits before the entrance.
If it feels wrong, it’s probably a city ordinance.
Bring back proof, not just stories.
Set two alarms. One for the job, one for coming back.
Remember: backups save lives and weekends.
Map the exits before the entrance smiles at you.
Pack tape. It fixes things money can’t reach.
If you’re late, be right. If you’re wrong, be fast.
Keep a lie ready that sounds like paperwork.
Don’t touch the shiny panel; it touches back.
If they say ‘urgent’, add hazard pay yourself.
Borrow a favor, pay it before it grows teeth.
Carry a seed snack. Heroism burns calories.
Let your shadow go first; it takes the photos.
