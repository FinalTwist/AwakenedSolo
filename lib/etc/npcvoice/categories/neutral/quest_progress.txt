Halfway’s still far from home.
If it got complicated, that’s how you know it’s real.
Keep your head. You’ll need it to nod at payday.
Stop to breathe. Air’s free on good days.
Send a ping when it’s safe to believe in it.
Eat something; success hates the hungry.
Remember names you pass. They remember you back.
Weather’s turning. Don’t let it turn you.
Locks open better when you’re calm.
Don’t narrate. Finish first.
If you’re still moving, it’s not over.
Check the corners hope forgets.
Answer texts with coordinates, not essays.
Drink water before the city taxes it.
Put your wins in your pocket—show them later.
Rehearse the story for the client, not the legend.
If a door laughs, try a window.
Rest five minutes. Not six.
Don’t teach the enemy your routine.
Stage the proof so it explains itself.
