Short by a little. Little is the hard part.
I can hold it till closing if that helps.
Come back after payday—or after a miracle.
Layaway exists for a reason; this is the reason.
Check the used bin; it’s kinder than it looks.
I’ve got a scratch-and-dent cousin to this, cheaper.
Maybe don’t eat fancy and it’s yours tomorrow.
Tell me a good story; I’ll trim the tax.
I’ll set an alert if the price falls asleep.
Bring a friend with pockets; split the burden.
Short, but not by character. I can see that.
I’ll put it behind the broken toaster—same price tomorrow.
Trade something you won’t miss until later.
Got loyalty points? I accept them as compliments.
Check the pawn wall; it forgives wallets.
I can loan the cable. Keep the hope.
Come back near closing. Prices get sleepy.
Tell me who sent you; maybe it helps.
I’ll call if someone returns one mad.
Don’t apologize. We’re all counting quietly.
