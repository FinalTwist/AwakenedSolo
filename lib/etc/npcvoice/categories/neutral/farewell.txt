Alright then—walk safe and don’t make change.
See you when the sirens cool down.
Take the side streets; they’re kinder this week.
If a drone tails you, wave like you meant it.
Keep the receipt; life asks for proof.
Check the sky before you cross anything.
Hope your next hour pays better than this one.
May the turnstile not steal your last coin.
Goodbye. Or good luck. Same price here.
Shuffle off before the forecast notices you.
Take a left at the mural; the cops ignore art.
Don’t ride the last train unless you like sermons.
If you see a flash, duck or pose—your call.
Keep coins for bathroom doors and stubborn turnstiles.
Let the drones pass first; they argue with momentum.
Text someone you trust. Or someone cheap.
Step around the manhole—steam’s mean.
Pocket your badge. Even the fake one.
If you run, look down before left. Cracks bite.
Save your breath; fines are based on oxygen.
