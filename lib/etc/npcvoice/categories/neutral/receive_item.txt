Thanks. I’ll log it like it matters.
I’ll keep this safe and slightly hidden.
Looks fragile. Life is too.
I’ll put it where honest people won’t look.
You didn’t see me take it; I didn’t see you hand it over.
I’ll find it a shelf that doesn’t wobble.
If it gets lost, it’ll be by accident, not by apology.
Receipt is optional; trust is required.
Give me a day and it’ll have a purpose.
I’ll make sure it helps someone eventually.
I’ll hide this where even I forget.
If it rattles, I didn’t hear it.
Comes with a story? I’ll store that too.
I’ll tuck it behind the ‘out of order’ sign.
If anyone asks, it was always here.
I’ll register it as ‘found optimism’.
Handle looks loose; so do most of us.
It fits the shelf like it’s paid rent.
Consider it parked with plausible deniability.
I’ll keep it warm and uninteresting.
