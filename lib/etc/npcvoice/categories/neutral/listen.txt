Heard worse plans. Most of them got memorials.
Quiet voices last longer; maybe that’s the point.
If it needs telling, it probably needs paying.
Say it once and then walk—walls have storage.
Sounds risky. Risk is what we trade in, I guess.
Names aren’t free. Keep yours on layaway.
Talk softer; the mics get jealous.
Don’t promise what the block will cancel.
Good idea. Bad timing. Standard package.
I didn’t hear it. You didn’t say it.
Keep the plan in pieces; no one can lose all of it.
If a stranger agrees too fast, they’re selling something.
Record everything; delete smart.
Don’t say the client’s name near the client’s building.
Split the cash before the risk, not after.
Pick a rendezvous with two exits and no opinions.
Jargon is camouflage; use simple words where it matters.
Turn off the ad filter before you move—banners hide cameras.
Speak the truth like a rumor, and the rumor like a dare.
If you leave a paper trail, make it call you ‘sir’.
