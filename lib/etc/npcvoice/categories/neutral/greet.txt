Hey—new face. Keep your head low and your creds lower.
Morning, I think. The sky hasn’t decided yet.
Careful on the curb; it bites when it rains.
Welcome to the block. Don’t feed the cameras.
Try the noodles if you can’t afford hope today.
Keep moving. Standing still is how trouble remembers you.
Rent’s due everywhere. Pick somewhere cheap to breathe.
Bad day? You’ll fit right in.
Watch the puddles—some of them are electrical.
Need directions or just an excuse to leave?
Rent’s climbing again; stairs too. Pace yourself.
Don’t trust a smile with perfect teeth in this district.
Watch for delivery bots—they don’t brake for humans.
If the noodle stall waves you in, say yes. It’s luck.
The ATM eats cards after midnight. So does the street.
Bag on your front, key between the fingers—city standard.
If the rain smells like citrus, hide. It’s solvent.
Keep your sleeves down; scanners are twitchy today.
Walk like you’re late and broke. It’s camouflage.
Welcome back if this isn’t your first bad idea.
