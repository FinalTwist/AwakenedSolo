That’s a finish line. Stumble through if you must.
I’ve seen worse outcomes. Not many.
Payment incoming—stand where the wind can find you.
Proof looks good. Smells like risk but reads like rent.
Client happy? That’s two miracles today.
File it under ‘earned the hard way’.
Eat warm food while it’s still warm.
Keep the boots on; tomorrow’s needy.
Tell it small. Big stories attract bills.
Good work. Now hide from the next favor.
Collect before they remember reasons.
Smile small; cameras farm smiles.
If you lost something, decide it was old.
Spend a little on something that warms.
Tell the truth soft; it travels farther.
Say ‘we’ if it keeps you safer.
Walk home a different way; celebrate the detour.
Save a copy off-grid. Memory is opinionated.
Tip someone who made your day invisible.
Don’t shop where you bled today.
