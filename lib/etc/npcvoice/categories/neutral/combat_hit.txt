That’s somebody’s medical debt growing.
Careful—kids sleep behind that wall.
Blood’s harder to scrub than you think.
That crunch sounded like next month’s paycheck.
Please, not the power conduit again.
Aim away from the bus line; commuters bite.
That one’s going to echo all night.
Noise complaint filed, mentally.
Medic! Or at least someone with clean rags.
Whoever wins, we still sweep.
Stop! The clinic’s three blocks—point that way.
Glass cuts hours after the fight. Sweep later.
One more like that and someone’s job vanishes.
That scream will wake the dogs and the drones.
Try not to invent a crater. We trip on those.
The echo’s going to sell tickets at midnight.
Whose blood? Doesn’t matter; we all mop.
Keep your friends behind the cart; it’s thick wood.
Save room for the apology you’re going to need.
Medical’s closed—patch with kindness or tape.
