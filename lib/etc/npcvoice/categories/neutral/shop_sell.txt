I can give you fair, not generous. Times are what they are.
Looks used, but in the respectable way.
I’ll clean the serials; you clean the story.
Cash now. Spend it before it forgets you.
I can move this. Slowly, but it’ll move.
Scratches are memories; buyers like boring ones.
If anyone asks, it came from a warehouse that never existed.
Counting out tens—less suspicious that way.
Tell yourself you never needed it anyway.
Come back when the fridge starts negotiating.
I’ll round up if you forget my name later.
Looks like it’s seen storms and kept receipts.
I can move it, but it will move me too. Price reflects that.
We’ll call it ‘refurbished by circumstances’.
Battery’s moody. Buyers like moody this season.
Tell me a cleaner story and I’ll add a ten.
Cash only; electrons gossip.
I’ll bundle it with a smile no one believes.
Fair price. Better than fair weather.
It’ll be gone by Friday. Wish I could say why.
