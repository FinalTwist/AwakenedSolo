Not here—my shift just started.
I got kids and two jobs; take it down the alley.
Please don’t redecorate the market again.
Someone call it in before it calls itself.
Count me as furniture. Very quiet furniture.
I’ll be behind this cart until sanity returns.
Keep your aim honest; I like my limbs attached.
Can we invoice whoever started this?
Mind the stall—those eggs are imported hope.
Try not to break the part of the street I use.
Kids live upstairs. Keep it vertical.
Shields on the fruit stand; the vendor’s a saint.
Nobody wants headlines today—make it quick.
Whatever this is, end it before lunch rush.
Take it to the loading dock; concrete forgives.
Fire escapes were built for running, not ballet.
Hands off the solar panels—tenants pay for those.
Easy with the flashbangs—grandma naps at noon.
Don’t knock the power—night shifts need fridges.
Remember the rule: fewer holes than last time.
