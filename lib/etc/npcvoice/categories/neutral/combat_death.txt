Somebody’s chair at dinner just went empty.
I’ll light a cheap candle later.
Another name the city won’t learn to pronounce.
Close the eyes. We can’t afford ghosts.
Call it in—no one should vanish uncounted.
Cover them. Rain’s got no manners.
Hope they left a message somewhere.
Move slow; dignity is the last service left.
Bag comes after a sigh. There it is.
Tomorrow will pretend this didn’t happen.
Tag the time. Their people will need to know.
Some prayers cost less if you whisper them.
We’ll carry the feet if you carry the news.
Check their pockets for a name, not a prize.
The rain will do the first cleaning. We’ll do the rest.
Tell the kids it was loud thunder, nothing more.
Cover the ink; sun fades the important parts.
Queue the song they liked. We’ll play it cheap.
Step back—dignity needs room to stand up.
Write down the corner; the city misplaces endings.
