Scope creep is your problem; outcome is ours.
Deliverables before feelings, always.
We expect excellence; you can approximate.
Sign here, here, and where it hurts.
Timeline is aggressive. Do keep up with it.
Success criteria: us smiling, you surviving.
We compensate in currency, not gratitude.
Your risk is our entertainment. Perform.
Stakeholders require a miracle—make it billable.
Ownership means you own the blame.
Please manage expectations, chiefly your own.
Escalate only if it entertains the board.
Bring proof not prose.
Assume surveillance; behave accordingly.
If you fail, fail upward—away from us.
Remember: plausibility first, heroics never.
Dependencies: luck, weather, and your competence—weighted accordingly.
Your signature is a confession we can frame.
Great—now stop talking and start justifying.
On success, you’ll get paid. On failure, you’ll get famous.
