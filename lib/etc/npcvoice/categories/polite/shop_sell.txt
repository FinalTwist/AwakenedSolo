Ah, an artifact of previous ambition.
We’ll acquire this memory at a discount.
Sentimental value is non-transferable. Sadly for you.
Consider it divestment therapy.
Resale price includes a dignity write-down.
We’ll launder the story, not the item.
Cash now; the item will pretend to have prestige later.
We buy futures in your past mistakes.
Serials intact? How rustic.
We’ll market it as ‘heritage’. Our audience loves lies.
It’s authentic in the way regret is authentic.
Thank you for liquidating your nostalgia with us.
Our offer is firm; your options aren’t.
Lovely scratches—character for those who can’t afford character.
We’ll underpay you efficiently. Time is money.
Receipt? Keep it. It reads like comedy.
Call it provenance; the rich adore synonyms for theft.
Your loss is our lifestyle brand.
Do sign here. It proves you can let go.
See you next downturn.
