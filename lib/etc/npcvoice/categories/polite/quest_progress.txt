On track? Define track.
Status green is a color, not a reality.
Pivot quietly; we invoice the noise.
Report in nouns, not feelings.
Blockers are just excuses with headshots.
Schedule slipped; pretend it danced.
Your progress reads like fiction. Sell it better.
Remember the goal: outcomes, not anecdotes.
If it hurts, brand it as innovation.
Cut scope before you cut corners we can see.
Sync with results; meetings are cosplay.
Metrics or silence—choose one.
Keep risk sedated and stakeholders entertained.
Nice hustle. Add rigor.
Your update lacks graphs and mercy.
Consider success the minimum viable outcome.
When in doubt, ship. Then swim.
Progress without receipts is mythology.
Less ceremony, more certainty.
Smile like it’s done. Then make it true.
