No. It offends both taste and legal.
We don’t buy subpoenas disguised as merchandise.
Bring heatless goods or bring nothing.
That’s evidence with delusions of grandeur.
Our insurance refuses to be in the same room as that.
Come back when your wares are less… autobiographical.
Even our dumpster has standards.
Pass. It’s whispering to the cameras.
We curate, we don’t collect disasters.
Try the quay—fish have lower ethics.
Declined; the price includes handcuffs.
Our brand doesn’t do ‘found behind police tape’.
Return with provenance, not problems.
That model attracts auditors like moths.
Hard reject. It clashes with freedom.
Put it down gently. Back away generously.
Not at any price you can pronounce.
We only stock liabilities we invented ourselves.
Your hustle is loud; our appetite is not.
Thank you for the warning dressed as a product.
