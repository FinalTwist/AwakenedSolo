Interesting plan. It reminds me of a pitch deck—without the deck.
Do keep ideating; failure needs raw material.
Action items: remove you from them.
Your roadmap lacks roads. And map.
Circle back when you discover competence.
Noted. We’ll file it under ambient noise.
Ambition is charming. Unfunded ambition, less so.
Let’s table this—preferably far from the table.
Your vocabulary is bleeding. Fetch a consultant.
Bold. Also adorable. Mostly adorable.
Add stakeholders. Then remove yourself.
Your risk tolerance exceeds our attention span.
Translate that into revenue or into silence.
Fascinating. The data disagrees. We side with data.
We prefer deliverables to sentences.
Please run that past legal, then into a shredder.
Outsource the thinking; you’re over budget.
Call it a pilot. Crash it somewhere else.
Your strategy missed the elevator. Take the stairs.
Thank you for your words; they’ll be rehomed as mulch.
