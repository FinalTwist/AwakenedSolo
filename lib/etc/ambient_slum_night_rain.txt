Rain braids window grilles into glittering nets.
A siren approaches, reconsiders, and fades like a rumor.
Bare feet slap through puddles; a door opens and swallows the sound.
A cracked speaker delivers a slow ballad to an empty balcony.
A bicycle chain squeals; someone shushes it with a splash of oil.
