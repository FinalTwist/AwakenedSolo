Blue TV light leaks through cardboard curtains; dialogue fights with crickets.
Footsteps approach, pause, and become laughter headed elsewhere.
A rooftop drum circle keeps imperfect time with an imperfect sky.
A scooter sputters, dies, then agrees to one more block.
A match flares, feeds a cigarette, and becomes a firefly impersonator.
