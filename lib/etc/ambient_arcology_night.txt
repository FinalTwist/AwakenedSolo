Public spaces dim to midnight mall glow; fountains trade volume for confidence.
A delivery swarm docks in sequence, yellow LEDs winking into green.
Observation deck glass acquires smudges shaped like awe.
An indoor breeze carries pepper from a closing restaurant and refuses to share.
An art display swaps to nocturnals: owls blink from looping trees.
