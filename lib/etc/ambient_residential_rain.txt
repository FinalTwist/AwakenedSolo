Drainpipes throat-song down the side of a townhome chorus.
Mailboxes glisten like fresh armor in a very small war.
A kid in a cape sprints through puddles, generates a weather system, is recalled by name.
A porch mat surrenders to a muddy boot and accepts its fate.
Garden lights halo raindrops until the breaker shows mercy.
