Water shoulders itself through a narrow throat and complains in echoes.
A rat drags a bright candy wrapper like a carnival float.
A maintenance tag swings from a pipe, clicking time against steel.
A bubble blooms on the surface, pops, and tattoos the air with sour chemistry.
Somewhere, a grate rattles as if it wants out.
