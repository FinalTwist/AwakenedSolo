Fluorescents strobe; the tunnel stares back in long, patient blinks.
A skateboard murmurs down the concourse, wheels telling secrets.
Turnstiles gossip in clicks; a late train answers with a metal yawn.
A busker tests a chord that lands perfectly in the empty space.
A maintenance cart glides past, stacked with orange dreams.
