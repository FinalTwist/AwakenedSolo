# List of mob VNUMs to use as base templates for adventurers.
# You can use brand-new prototypes you add to lib/world/mob/ or existing "humanoid" mobs.
# IMPORTANT: In src/spec_assign.cpp, assign each of these VNUMs to adventurer_spec with ASSIGNMOB().
# Example:
# ASSIGNMOB(99001, adventurer_spec);  // Adventurer: Samurai
# ASSIGNMOB(99002, adventurer_spec);  // Adventurer: Adept
# Fill with your actual VNUMs below, one per line:
# 99001
# 99002
# 99003
1401
