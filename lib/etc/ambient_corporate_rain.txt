Umbrellas collapse at the threshold like black flowers relieved of duty.
Water beads race down the atrium glass; the fastest wins nothing.
A security guard shakes rain from a cap and resumes being ornamental.
A delivery pod docks with a polite chime and no apology for the weather.
The revolving door swallows a gust and spits it out neatly.
