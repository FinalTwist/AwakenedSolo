Driveways shine; reflections of windows stack like card tricks.
A lone skateboard rattles under a carport, then stills with a soft thunk.
Water beads on a chrome mailbox and falls with ceremonial precision.
Night jasmine leans into the storm and wins on points.
A motion light flares at a passing moth and logs a victory.
