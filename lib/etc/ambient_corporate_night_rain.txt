Lightning fingerprints the façade; tinted windows keep their secrets.
Mop water gleams under track lights like a runway to nowhere.
A vending wall hums a low chord; LEDs pulse in patient rhythm.
A courier bins a dripping poncho, scans out, vanishes into storm.
The lobby’s sculpture collects droplets on titanium ribs.
