Rain drills the corrugated roof; leaks surrender in clean, spaced lines.
Runoff draws temporary maps down a stained wall, recharting as gusts decide.
A loading bay becomes a shallow lake; boots part it into two tired rivers.
A strap pops on a pallet; shrinkwrap crackles like dry lightning.
The air tastes like hot metal cooled too fast.
