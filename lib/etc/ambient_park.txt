Wind nudges prayer ribbons; knotted wishes rattle like soft bones.
A jogger’s mag-sole slips on moss, recovers, continues without breaking rhythm.
A gull chooses a statue’s head and leaves a white autograph down the bronze cheek.
A drone gardener mists a bed of gene-tuned lilies; their petals tighten, then relax.
A fountain coin hops as the pump cycles, flashing dull gold before sinking.
