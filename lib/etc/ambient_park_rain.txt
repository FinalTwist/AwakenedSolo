Rain beads on waxy leaves, then slides off in perfect spheres to the gravel.
A bench plaque drinks water until the inscription is a silver blur.
Mud freckles pant cuffs; the path answers each step with a soft complaint.
Geese vote against the weather and march toward the gazebo in sullen order.
The fountainâ€™s spray defeats the downpour, sending mist sideways into the hedges.
