PICKPOCKET

PICKPOCKET

Steal from an ^yalert^n target’s pockets.

- Your odds come from stealth (sneak/visibility) vs. the target’s awareness.
- Crowds and bright light make it harder; being sneaky helps.
- Failure can raise ^RHEAT^n and draw attention.

For a quick preview before acting, try ^gCASE <target>^n.
